This project implements a variety of sorting algorithms in PYTHON DSA HTML CSS JS. 
The main objective is to showcase different sorting techniques, including **Bubble Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and others. 
The repository provides the implementation of these algorithms.
### Features:
- Implements multiple sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Heap Sort**
- Example usage and test cases
- Visual representation of sorting (step wise)



How to use :
The screen opens with enter numbes sorting techniques and start sorting 
enter the numbers to be sorted
select the sorting technique 
click on start sorting 
you can see a visual representaion on how the sorting is done

Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are methods for arranging a collection of elements in a particular order, typically in ascending or descending order. In computer science, sorting is essential for tasks like organizing data, searching, and optimizing algorithms. This project implements multiple sorting algorithms with varying time complexities, which can be used in different scenarios depending on the dataset.
