PROJECT NAME:-Sorting Algorithms

PROBLEM:-Develop a web-based sorting algoritms to visually demonstrate the steps for sorting . The goal is to make understanding the sorting techniques intuitive and engaging for learners and educators.

OUTPUT:- A Flask-based web application was implemented where users can input array of number to sort in ascending order. The application dynamically renders the steps of algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a visual representation of steps of each sort representation. The backend handles sorting logic and types of sorts.
The program outputs the sorted version of a given unsorted list or dataset. It also provides insights into the execution time and steps taken by each algorithm.

METHODOLOGY:- Users input comma-separated array of values to sort them using specific sortings.The Python backend processes these values, performing sortings and displays the steps of sloving them.The select sort allows you to select the specific sort that you want to use.start sorting allows you to see the output and see the dynamicall steps of each method.The application dynamically renders the steps of algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a visual representation of steps of each sort representation. The backend handles sorting logic and types of sorts.

CONCLUSION:- This sorting algorithm stimulator successfully integrates Python for logical operations and web technologies for visualization, creating an interactive learning tool. It aids users in comprehending sorting operations through hands-on interaction and step feedback, enhancing the learning experience.
